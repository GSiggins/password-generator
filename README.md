## Github repo: https://github.com/GSiggins/password-generator

### Workflow
-Defined arrays containing each set of character types (Upper/Lowercase/Number/Special).

-Wrote initial prompt to ask how long of a password the user wants.

-Wrote exceptions for things that were not numbers or outside of the range by using parseInt to convert 
input to numbers.

-Used confirms and IF logic to append arrays of chosen character types into one array of possible characters.

-Used a FOR loop to choose random values from the possible characters and put them into an array called RESULT.

-Inserted RESULT into password textbox for user to copy/paste
